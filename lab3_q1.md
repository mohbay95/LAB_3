# Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)
***
##### Human-Computer interaction(HCI)
is a feild of study that focues on the design and use of computer technology,particularly the interaction between human(users) and computers.HCI combines elements of **computer science,cognitive psychology,** and **design** to create interfaces that are intuitive and user-freindly.

## KEY Areas in HCI
* [x] User Interface(UI) design
* [x] Usability Testing
* [x] Interaction Design
* [x] User Experience(UX)Research
* [x] Accessibility and Inclusive Desing

### Core Concept in HCI
1. **User-Centered Design (UCD):** A design process that focuses on the needs, preferences, limitation of the end user.
2. **Prototyping and Iteration:** Building early models (prototypes) and refining them based on user feedback.
3. **Useability Metrics:** Evaluating how effectively and efficently users can achieve thier goals using an interface.

## Common Techniques in HCI
Dircetive| Purpose| Example 
--- | --- | ---
Wireframing|Create a basic layout for an interface|Sketching out a mobile app design
Usability Testing | Assess the ease of use for users | Running test sessions with participants
A/B Testing |Compare two versions of a design to see which performs better | Testing two versions of a website
